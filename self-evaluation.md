### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- Feel pretty good on arrays so far but defintely need to practice more. Took me way longer than it should to realize I need to add values to the booleans in the array than I would like to admit. 

### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Intend to read through the entire array Ruby doc to parse out any gaps in my knowledge and practice them today.

### What questions do you have about Arrays?
- I am a little unclear when parentheses vs brackets should be used when using methods on arrays. Got an error sometimes using one over another (namely parentheses) and was not entirely sure why.
